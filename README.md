# Amazon-Forest-Fires
To visualize the project I have created a streamlit webpage that runs all the scripts and explains them. In command prompt(CMD) enter 'streamlit run streamlitWebpage.py' and it will load the site.

Data analysis of Amazon forest fires from 1998 to 2017. Shows data of monthly yearly number of forest fires in all of the different regions and its analisis with charts, statistics, dataframes and probabilities. Also includes to evolution of rainfall and temperature in Brazil to analize the correlation.
